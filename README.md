# Simple D&D Character Manager

A (very) simple Character Manager!

Allows to manage characters mostly manually. It will apply stat modifiers for all abilities. However, you do need to input much of your inventory and spells manually.

## Requirements

On Ubuntu systems, you need the dotnet sdk and runtime which you can install with this command :
```
sudo apt install dotnet8 dotnet-sdk-8.0 dotnet-runtime-8.0
```

The SDK can be skipped to run a prebuilt binary (not currently available as the project is still incomplete)

## How To Build

I use a Linux system so adapt depending on your system but here is how I do it.

First, clone the repo if you haven't already
```
git clone https://github.com/Shijikori/simple-character-manager.git
```

Next, build the application with like so
```
cd simple-character-manager
dotnet build .
```

Finally, run your build
```
bin/Debug/net8.0/simple-character-manager
```
